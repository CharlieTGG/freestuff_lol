    <p><h2>[Verse 1]
        You've been trolled, you've been trolled
        Yes, you've probably been told
        Don't reply to this guy
        He's just trying to get a rise
        Out of you, yes, it's true
        You respond and that's his cue
        To start trouble on the double
        While he strokes his manly stubble
        
        [Verse 2]
        You've been trolled, you've been trolled
        You should probably just fold
        When the only winning move is not to play
        And yet you keep on trying, mindlessly replying
        You've been trolled, you've been trolled, have a nice day</h2></p>
